The Project “Trusted Advisor” aims to correlate education with employment and translate academic performance to better placement rates. The product aims to enhance the placement rates of colleges/universities, by analyzing the performance of their students and suggesting on how it can be improved. While doing so, it also takes into account the expenses of the college, the skills and expertise of the mentor entrusted with the responsibility to teach the students and gain better insights on how it can impact the student performance and placement.
